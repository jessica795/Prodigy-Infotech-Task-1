Creating a Bar or Histogram Visualization You can use this code to create a bar or histogram visualization of the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable in your population dataset. For example, you can visualize the distribution of ages or gender in the population.

Population Age Distribution Visualization
This project allows you to create a bar chart to visualize the age distribution within a population dataset. It's a tool for gaining insights into the age demographics of a population
Introduction
Understanding the distribution of ages within a population is crucial for various analyses and decision-making processes. This project simplifies the process by providing a Python script to create a bar chart visualisation.

Prerequisites
Before using the code, ensure you have the prerequisites installed

Getting Started
Data Preparation
Ensure you have the relevant population data in an Excel file (e.g., "2.1_Population_dynamics.xlsx") located in the same directory as your script.
The Excel file should contain a column with age data (e.g., 'Age').
Copy and paste the provided code for creating a bar chart visualization
3.Executing the Visualization

Run the script.
The code will load the data, process it, and create a bar chart representing the age distribution in the population dataset.
Usage
Use this project to:

Gain insights into the age distribution of a population.
Visualise age demographics for various analysis purposes.
