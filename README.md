Prodigy_InfoTech_Data-Science_Task-01
To create a histogram and box plot of population data,you can visualize the code to view the distribution of data over different age groups
This project allows you to create a bar chart to visualize the age distribution within a population dataset. It's a tool for gaining insights into the age demographics of a population
Understanding the distribution of ages within a population is crucial for various analyses and decision-making processes. This project simplifies the process by providing a Rcode to create a bar chart visualisation.

Prerequisites
Before using the code, ensure you have the prerequisites installed 

Getting Started
Data Preparation
Ensure you have the relevant population data in an Excel file (e.g., "2.1_Population_dynamics.xlsx") located in the same directory as your script.
The Excel file should contain a column with age data (e.g., 'Age').
Copy and paste the provided code for creating a bar chart visualization
3.Executing the Visualization

The code will load the data, process it, and create a bar chart representing the age distribution in the population.

Use this project to:
Gain insights into the age distribution of a population.
Visualise age demographics for various analysis purposes.
